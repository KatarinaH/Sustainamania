		<h1>water</h1>
		<p>From keeping us healthy, to growing our food, to preserving natural environments, a plentiful supply of water is essential to the wellbeing of people and our planet. And, because we use a lot of water to produce and care for garments, it’s essential to our business too.</p>

		<p>Today, clean freshwater is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. As a global, influential company, we have a role to play in conserving water ecosystems and improving people’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation.</p>

		<p>And, with our water strategy and a three-year partnership with WWF, we’re well on our way to becoming the leading water steward in our industry.</p>

		<p>Our strategy has been described as game changing in the way it looks holistically at water as a global resource.</p>

		<p>We work to promote responsible use of water along the product’s lifecycle, from how cotton farmers water their crops, to how our customers wash their clothes. Our unique approach also includes going beyond the factory walls and influence how water is managed.</p>

		<p>Our goal is that everyone and everything that depends on water resources should have their needs met.</p>
